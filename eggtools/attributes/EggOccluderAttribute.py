    This makes the first (or only) polygon within this group node into an occluder.
    The polygon must have exactly four vertices.  An occluder polygon is invisible.

    When the occluder is activated with model.set_occluder(occluder),
    objects that are behind the occluder will not be drawn.

    This can be a useful rendering optimization for complex scenes,
